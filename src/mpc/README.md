# MPC Protocols

StoffelMPC aims to support robust general purpose MPC protocols in order to provide developers with a minimal set of reasonable MPC protocols for use with blockchains.
StoffelMPC does not make any assumptions about how the MPC nodes are determined and this is up to the developer of the MPC sidechain in question to decide.
